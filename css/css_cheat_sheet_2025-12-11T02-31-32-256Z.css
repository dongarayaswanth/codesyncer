flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

flex-direction: This CSS property defines the direction items are placed in the container,
row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
column: Items are placed top to bottom.
column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.

we can apply the order property to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).
Another property you can apply to individual items is align-self. This property accepts the same values as align-items and its value for the specific item.

flex-wrap : used for spreading
nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.

The two properties flex-direction and flex-wrap are used so often together that the shorthand property flex-flow was created to combine them. This shorthand property accepts the value of the two properties separated by a space.
For example, you can use flex-flow: row wrap to set rows and wrap them.

space-around: Lines display with equal spacing around them.
stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.
